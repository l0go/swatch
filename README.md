# Swatch
Extremely simple tool to convert time to swatch. It was a fun exercise to play with Haxe's date class!

## Usage
```
swatch - converts time to swatch internet time
usage: swatch [time]
Time parameter can be emitted for current time. It can be formatted as:
    - "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss"
    - "YYYY-MM-DD"
    - "hh:mm:ss"
```

## Future plans
Not sure if I have time for it right now, but turning this into some form of TUI clock would be real neat!

It would also be fun to do this in an esoteric language like Haskell or Rust to see how they compare to Haxe. Originally I planned to write this in Zig but the date library seemed below par. Maybe now that I wrote it in Haxe it would be easier to translate.
